## AI Agent for Sudoku

In my first project as part of the AI Nanodegree at Udacity, I created an AI agent that can solve any Sudoku puzzle including Diagonal Sudoku's in a fraction of a second. The AI agent uses various constraint propogation techniques to find the solution including Eliminate, Only Choice, and Naked Twins.

This project is written in Python 3 and includes a UI visualization via Pygame.
